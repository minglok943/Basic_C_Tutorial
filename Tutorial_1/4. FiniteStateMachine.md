The example above shows how we can use FSM in our coding. By doing so, the steps are organized in a logical way so that we can easily understand the logic. Moreover, that's say if we observe a bug while we are in ORDERING_PIZZA State, we only need to check the code in the Ordering state. Similarly, we can use the same idea in our Robots, probably there will be an Idle state, Initialize state, and Working State. It is extremely helpful as our code for robots definitely more complex than this example.
