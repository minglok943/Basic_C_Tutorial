## **Library**
### What is library?
Simply put, a library is a collection of items that you can call from your program.

### Benefit of library
It obviously has a lot of advantages, not least of which is that you can save much time by reusing work someone else has already done and been more confident that it has fewer bugs (since probably many other people use the libraries too, and you benefit from having them finding and fixing bugs). A library is exactly like an executable, except instead of running directly, the library functions are invoked with parameters from your executable.

### Make our own library
Let's imagine a scenario in which we are going to write code for our robot car, what does the car compose of? At least we need some wheels, a steer, and screws are a common component for both wheels and steer. 

#### Bad example
```c
struct Screw{
    float length;
    float width;
    float weight;
    int color;
}
struct Steer{
    Screw screws[12];
    int direction;
};
void autoSteering(Steer* steer){
    //auto steering control
}
void OptimizeSteeringControl(Steer* steer){
    //optimized steer control
}
struct Wheel{
    Screw screws[10];
    bool clockwise;
    int speed;
};
void MoveForward(Wheel* wheels, int wheelsNum, int speed){
    //moving forward
}
void OptimizeSteeringControl(){
    //optimized speed control
}
bool running = true;
int main(){
    Wheel wheels[4];
    Steer steer;
    for(int i = 0; i < sizeof(wheels)/sizeof(Wheel); i++)
        wheels.speed = 100;
    while(running){
        //do something...
    }
}
```
We can write all our code in a single file, it might look not too messy now, but as the code grows more and more complex, it will be hard for you to read and maintain(sometimes even just finding where you want to modify can be hard).
Therefore, if we organize related objects into the same header files(libraries), it will be more logical and easy to read. 

### Structure of the program
Using the example we mentioned just now, we can separate code into several libraries. The libraries structure is shown below: 
![libraries structure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80484903/139177227-59943057-5edc-4083-bf08-acbe520a7547.png)

### Using #ifndef, #define and #endif to avoid repetitively include
So you might notice a problem now. If both Steer.h and Wheel.h include Screw.h, whether or not Screw.h will be included twice? The answer is yes, but we can prevent it from happening by using #ifndef, #define, and #endif. Before every header files, add these two lines
```c
#ifndef OBJECT_NAME_H  
#define OBJECT_NAME_H
```
and at the end add

```c
#endif
```
But why this can prevent repetitively include libraries? Let's say if the compiler includes Steer.h first. Then the compiler will include Screw.h because it is included by Steer.h, the statement "#ifndef SCREW_H" in Screw.h will be true since there is no SCREW_H defined before. The second line of the code "SCREW_H" will be defined. After including Steer.h and Screw.h, the compiler will include Wheel.h. Here a cool thing happened. When the compiler tries to include Screw.h again, the first line "#ifndef" will be false(noted that the SCREW_H is already been defined when Screw.h be included the first time). Therefore the compiler will not include anything until it reaches the last line "#endif". In conclusion, The three libraries are included only once so that our code won't have two Screw structures.

#### Better way to organize codes
```c
//Steer.h
#ifndef STEER_H
#define STEER_H
#include "Screw.h"
struct Steer{
    Screw screws[12];
    int direction;
};
/**
 * @brief      Make car auto steering
 * @param[in]  <Steer*>  The steer object that is auto-controlled
 */
void autoSteering(Steer* steer);

/**
 * @brief      Control steer
 * @@param[in]  <Steer*> The steer object that is controlled
 */
void OptimizeSteeringControl(Steer* steer);
#endif
```

```c
//Steer.c
void autoSteering(Steer* steer){
    //auto steering control
}
void OptimizeSteeringControl(Steer* steer){
    //optimized steer control
}
```

```c
//Wheel.h
#ifndef WHEEL_H
#define WHEEL_H
#include "Screw.h"

struct Wheel{
    Screw screws[10];
    bool clockwise;
    int speed;
};
/**
 * @brief      Moving forward
 * @param[in]  <Wheel*>  The wheel objects that are set to certain speed
 * @param[in]  <int>  The number of wheel objects
 * @param[in]  <int>  The speed are being set
 */
void MoveForward(Wheel* wheels, int wheelsNum, int speed);

/**
 * @brief      Control Speed
 */
void OptimizeSpeedControl();
#endif
```

```c
//Wheel.c
void MoveForward(Wheel* wheels, int wheelsNum, int speed){
    //moving forward
}
void OptimizeSteeringControl(){
    //optimized speed control
}
```

```c
//main.c
#include "Wheel.h"
#include "Steer.h"
int main(){
    Wheel wheels[4];
    Steer steer;
    
    while(running){
        MoveForward(wheels, 4, 100);
        OptimizeSteeringControl(steer);
        //do something else...
    }
}
```

### Conclusion of library
As we organize files by libraries(.h) and implementations(.c), it comes with some advantages. Firstly, we can easily tell what does a certain function does since it is written with a nice description in header files. Secondly, if we are using the libraries that we have written before, we can directly include them rather than copy paste the whole struct and functions. Lastly, sometimes when we try to use others' libraries, we only need to look at how to call functions, what are the parameters of it, and what is the return value, etc. If you are not modifying that library or seeing how it is implemented, we don't really care about the complex mathematical operations inside a function(as long as it works lol).
