# Prerequisite: 
Understood the concept of struct and union in C

# 1. Data Alignment
```C
typedef struct{
	char expiryDate[10];
	int servingSize;
	double calciumPerServing;
}Milk_Brand;

int main(void){
	Milk_Brand DutchLady={"15.10.2021", 1000, 1.14};
	Milk_Brand GoodDay={"26.10.2021", 2000, 2.36};
  ....
}
```
Question:
- What is the size of struct Milk_Brand?
- Draw a diagram to show the arrangment of data of the struct
- Explain briefly why?
- What if the type of calciumPerServing is of float type?

# 2. Bit Fields
```C
union{
	uint8_t byte;
	struct{
	uint8_t bit0 :1;
	uint8_t bit1 :1;
	uint8_t bit2 :1;
	uint8_t bit3 :1;
	uint8_t bit4 :1;
	uint8_t bit5 :1;
	uint8_t bit6 :1;
	uint8_t bit7 :1;
}byte_t;
```



# 3. Passing Struct to Function
